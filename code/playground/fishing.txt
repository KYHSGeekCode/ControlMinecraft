The process of waiting for a fish to bite involves patience, attention to the task at hand and a small dose of luck.
Fishing
is the use of a
fishing rod
to obtain items, usually
fish
.

Catching fish
[
]
A fishing bobber in
Bedrock Edition
.
A newly obtained Fishing Rod with the enchantments Lure II, Unbreaking III and Luck of the Sea II.
To fish, the player must
use
a
fishing rod
to cast the line into a body of
water
. The player's position does not matter; the player can be in the water, underwater, sitting in a
boat
, or standing on adjacent land.
Fish
can be caught just as readily in small, shallow, and/or player-created pools, both aboveground and underground.
The
bobber
must be watched closely. Small splashes can be seen around the bobber.
Once the bobber hits water, the wait time is determined, and the player must wait for a random period between 5 and 30 seconds (100 to 600 ticks at 20
ticks
per second) before the hook catches something.
Each level of the
Lure
enchantment on a fishing rod subtracts 5 seconds from both the minimum and maximum wait time. If it causes the wait time to be less than 0, a new wait time is generated in the next tick.
If the bobber is not directly exposed to
sun
or
moonlight
, the wait time is approximately doubled (each tick has a 50% chance of not decrementing the count). For direct exposure, all
blocks
above the bobber must be
transparent
to sunlight, such as
glass
and
carpet
. Blocks that diffuse
sky light
, such as
ice
and
leaves
, will block direct exposure. The presence of
clouds
or
rainfall
has no effect on direct exposure.
If the bobber's block is being rained on, the wait time is reduced by approximately
1
⁄
4
(each tick has a 25% chance of counting down 2 instead of 1). The bobber must be located in a
biome
where it is currently raining and all blocks above it must not block movement (e.g.
torch
,
tripwire
).
After the wait period has passed, a trail of fishing
particles
appear, approaching the bobber in a serpentine path (provided that the Particles
Video Setting
is not set to Minimal). After 1 to 4 seconds the particles reach the bobber, the bobber dips below the surface, and the player has a approximately half a second‌
[
Bedrock Edition
only
]
or evenly-distributed one to two seconds‌
[
Java Edition
only
]
to reel in the line before the waiting time resets. Removing the bobber from water during this interval secures the caught item on the line.
Upon a successful reel-in:
A
raw cod
,
raw salmon
,
pufferfish
,
tropical fish
, junk, or a treasure item appears (see
junk and treasure
below), flies toward the player, and is added to the player's inventory. If the player's
inventory
is full, the item will drop on the ground. While the item normally flies directly to the player's position, the item may hit blocks positioned between the bobber and the player, causing it to bounce off at an angle.
The rod's durability is reduced by 1 point. This can vary depending on the circumstances; see
below
.
An
experience orb
worth 1–6 experience points spawns at the position of the player. Consequently, a
Mending
-enchanted
fishing rod
used only for fishing never wears out, repairing itself if damaged.
If the player wanders more than 32 blocks away from the bobber, or if the player stops holding a fishing rod, the bobber and fishing line disappear with no durability reduction to the rod.
The bobber floats up to the water's surface even if the fishing rod is used from underwater unless it hooks onto a
mob
such as
squid
or is obstructed by a block.
Fish
mobs do not attempt to bite the fish hook and bobber, but can be hooked and reeled as with other mobs.
Junk and treasure
[
]
The fishing rod can occasionally catch treasure or junk instead of fish. A fishing rod without the
Luck of the Sea
enchantment has an 85% chance of catching fish, a 10% chance of catching junk, and a 5% chance of catching treasure. Each level of the Luck of the Sea enchantment increases the chance of catching a treasure at the expense of reducing the chances of catching fish and junk. The
Luck
status effect grants the same benefit.
To catch items in the treasure category, the bobber must be in open water, defined as the 5×4×5 vicinity around the bobber resting on the water surface (2 blocks away horizontally, 2 blocks above the water surface, and 2 blocks deep). Each horizontal layer in this area must consist only of
air
and
lily pads
or
water
source blocks,
waterlogged
blocks without collision (such as signs, kelp, or coral fans), and
bubble columns
. These conditions are checked every
tick
to determine if the player is eligible to receive treasure from a fishing attempt. If the conditions are not met, only items in the fish and junk categories can be obtained from fishing.

This table presents the loot possibilities that differ from the above table for a player fishing in one of the following biomes: Jungle, Sparse jungle, and Bamboo jungle. Items listed in the above table but not the table below remain unchanged regardless of the biome in which the player is fishing.
The percentages for Unenchanted chance and Luck of the Sea of Junk item may be inaccurate.

In
Bedrock Edition
, cod and salmon are the only fish that can be caught in
jungle
biomes and variants.
Fishing rod durability
[
]
See also:
Fishing Rod § Usage
The
fishing rod
has 64 units of durability in
Java Edition
and 384 units in
Bedrock Edition
. Each use costs 1 point, and the rod breaks when all durability is consumed. The number of uses can be increased if the
Unbreaking
or
Mending
enchantments are applied.
Reeling in while the bobber is in the air or in the water with nothing caught on it costs no durability.
Reeling in and successfully catching fish, junk or treasure costs 1 durability.
Reeling in while the bobber is stuck in a solid block costs 2 durability.
Reeling in a dropped item costs 3 durability.
Reeling in an entity that is not a dropped item costs 5 durability.
A fishing rod with the
Mending
enchantment has effectively infinite durability from incrementally repairing itself if used for fishing only, and the player isn't wearing damaged Mending armor or holding a damaged Mending item in the offhand.
The durability cost is subtracted on reel-in, rather than on hooking. Therefore, no penalty is levied for switching to another item or dropping the rod instead of reeling in.
History
[

Java Edition Alpha
v1.2.0
?
Added fishing.
The algorithm is as follows: each tick has a
1
⁄
500
chance of catching a
fish
, with an average time between catches of 346 ticks.
Java Edition Beta
1.5
Added
rain
, which improves chances of catching a fish. During a rainstorm, each tick has a
1
⁄
300
chance to catch a fish, reducing the average time between catches from 346 ticks to 207 ticks, a 40% decrease.
Java Edition
1.4.2
12w37a
Fishing now gives the
player
experience
with each

The Lure enchantment no longer affects the chances of catching things, only the delay.
The Luck of the Sea enchantment is broken due to a typo in the new fishing loot table.
Fished junk is now less damaged (0%–90% durability remaining) while treasure is more damaged (0%–25% durability remaining).
Ink sacs can now be caught singly with weight 10 (formerly a stack of 10 with weight 1).

Treasure can now be obtained only through fishing in open water.
Open water is defined as a 5×4×5 area around the bobber, in which only air, water source blocks, or waterlogged blocks without collision can be present.
Tripwire
,
bubble columns
, and
lily pads
all invalidate open water.
20w13a
Open water is now calculated differently.
Each layer in the area around the bobber is checked, and each layer must have only air
or
water (or similar).
Bubble columns no longer invalidate water layer checks and lily pads no longer invalidate air layer checks.

Trivia
[
]
If the players casts the bobber into a waterfall, the bobber floats up the waterfall until it reaches the top and remains there until the player either pulls it back in or catches fish on the line. If a
fish
is caught on the line, the bobber then falls down the waterfall.
The
player
can catch fish even if occupying the same block space as the bobber.
The
player
can freely switch between fishing rods after casting the bobber, with the enchantments on the casting rod being preserved in the bobber. This means that one rod can hook an item and another can reel it in, and the durability cost is subtracted from the rod currently equipped.
The
player
can obtain the
achievement
'Cow Tipper' from reeling in
leather
‌
[
BE

]
